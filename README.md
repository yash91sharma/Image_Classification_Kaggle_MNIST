# Image_Classification_Kaggle_MNIST

1) Principal Component Analysis used to reduce the data from 784 to 50 variables

2) Used Random Forest model for classification - Overall Accuracy ~95%. The model misclassifies/suffers with similar looking digits like 0, 3, 5 and 8.

3) Used Neural Network model for classification - Overall Accuracy ~96%. The model performs better with similar looking digits as compared to the Random Forest Model above.
